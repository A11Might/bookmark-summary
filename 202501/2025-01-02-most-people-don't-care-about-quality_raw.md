My friend, the [photographer Paul Clarke](https://paulclarke.com/) has an uncanny eye for detail. Every single shot he publishes is beautiful - they capture life in a way that I don't have the language to describe. I'm quite content to point my phone at someone, use the default settings, and grab a snap. My photos lack composition, clarity, focus, _mise-en-scène_, proper lighting and a thousand-and-one details that I've never even thought of.

Paul has published [an essay about official photographs of politicians](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/paulclarke6_new-appointment-photos-set-a-tone-sometimes-activity-7215046537209393152-vo92). In it, he expertly points out the various deficiencies of some of them and where they show a distinct lack of quality.

But, here's the thing, I don't think anyone other than a photographer would notice or care about those "problems".

If you're a website designer, you're always noticing "jank" on other sites. Your skin crawls at the poor kerning, the FOUT, the lack of keyboard navigation, improper contrast ratio, and a dozen other flaws. 99% of users just don't care. It doesn't impact them in any meaningful way.

A decade ago, I ranted about how [designers were chasing a perfection which would never be noticed by non-experts](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2013/01/are-designers-crazy/). You may take pride in your craft, but the majority of people _physically_ cannot notice the difference between good and bad design. Not even subconsciously.

I include myself in this maddening desire for unnoticeable perfection. I've got several [rants about things most people would find inconsequential](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/tag/rant/). There are things which I _know_ to be important in terms of technical correctness, but which most people couldn't give a shit about.

There's a brilliant essay by Will Tavlin called "[Casual Viewing - Why Netflix looks like that](https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-49/essays/casual-viewing/)".

In it, the author (correctly and fairly) skewers Netflix's model of producing huge amounts of low-quality content for an undiscerning audience. The creatives recoil in horror and the æsthetic choices, poor scripting, and lack of creative pizazz. Everything is mediocre at best and that's destroying the creative industries.

But, much like designers fretting about [getting things Pixel Perfect](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2018/11/the-myth-of-the-pixel-perfect-grid/) or photographers complaining about [background composition](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/paulclarke6_watch-your-background-youll-see-this-activity-7153041835630759936-x0gv) or musicians ranting about [the loudness wars](https://www.musicianwave.com/the-loudness-war/) - the _hoi polloi_ just don't care.

And, frankly, who can blame them? Take this quote from the Netflix essay:

> The difference between Netflix and its predecessors is that the older studios had a business model that rewarded cinematic expertise and craft.

Bluntly, I don't think that's true. Look at [the amount of movies Elvis was in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley_on_film_and_television#Film). A couple of good ones, sure. But the majority are literally just "This demographic will pay a dollar to see Elvis on screen; so put him on screen". You only need to look at the various lists of [highest grossing movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films) to see that the viewing public don't necessarily reward expertise and craft.

In an essay called "[Fraught Pleasures: Domestic Trauma and Cinephilia in American Culture](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3kn4p9v2)", the author points out that in the movie "Scream" (a movie ostensibly about movies) nobody goes to the cinema. Their entertainment is schlocky VHS tapes of low-budget and low-quality horror films. The nearest they get to discussing the quality of movie making is when one character recommends renting "[All The Right Moves](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085154/)" because:

> If you pause it at just the right place, you can see \[Tom Cruise’s\] penis!

Quality!

Netflix, so the essay argues, has perfected the art of designing content for "casual viewing". Something you can have on in the background while cooking, playing a game, or doom-scrolling.

> Several screenwriters who’ve worked for the streamer told me a common note from company executives is “have this character announce what they’re doing so that viewers who have this program on in the background can follow along.”

So? Not everything should be hard work. After a long day, most people don't _want_ to work for their leisure. People don't want to expend cognitive energy on interpreting what a story means. [Forget Subtext - People Don't Even Get Surtext](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2024/05/forget-subtext-people-dont-even-get-surtext/).

We also have the problem that close to 100% of culture is now readily available to us. Why take a risk on something new when you could watch something _guaranteed_ to be good? An executive at Amazon's streaming division recalls receiving an email which said:

> ‘here are the one hundred movies that people are watching most on Amazon SVOD today by the minute.’ It was always a lot of Tom Cruise sci-fi movies, action movies from the ’90s and aughts, and Talladega Nights.

You want to get everyone dancing at your party. Do you put on some experimental music that no one has heard of? No - you stick on ABBA and watch the dance-floor fill up.

Want something with a guaranteed number of chuckles-per-minute? Friends is there for you.

When you visit Paris, do you go to some little art gallery showcasing new artists or do you visit Le Louvre? You, like everyone else, bask in front of the [Mona Lisa](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2018/06/how-i-became-leonardo-da-vinci-on-the-blockchain/).

Finally, we reach the inevitble endgame of Netflix. Cut out the authors, actors, directors, make-up artists, sound designers, and the hundreds of other unionised parasites involved in making a modern show. Go straight to AI and create an infinite and endless stream of algorithmically-designed crowd-pleasing content.

> Streaming platforms are the only place where this \[AI Generated\] garbage makes any sense — a place where it would never be watched at all.

Hard disagree. Not because I think AI slop is good; but because the audience doesn't care. Most people don't notice the wires on the special effects. They can't see that the lighting is wrong on the CGI shot. The [lead actor's shitty accent](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/10-worst-accents-cinema-history/) passes without comment.

I'm not trying to slur people when I say that the majority are unsophisticated - because I include myself amongst them.

Audiophiles complain about MP3 compression and crappy headphones. Most of us just want to listen to our tunes, not listen to the equipment.

Cinephiles complain about poorly calibrated projectors and or motion smoothing on TVs. Most of us just want to crunch popcorn and see big explosions.

Fact-checkers complain about [fictional quotes from famous people](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/04/who-do-you-think-you-are-kidding-mr-feynman/). Most of us just want a daily dose of something that sounds like wisdom.

Pornographers [complain about the move from gorgeous celluloid to low fidelity videotape](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118749/quotes/?item=qt0304288&ref_=ext_shr_lnk). Most of us just want to rent a VHS rather than visit a cinema for our extra-special-personal-time.

Fashionistas [decry the homogeneity of modern dress](https://putthison.com/when-i-was-young-there-were-beatniks-hippies/). Most of us think jeans and a t-shirt are basically fine.

Is the quality of pizza better from a tiny restaurant hidden away in an Italian village using only fresh ingredients? I'm sure it is. But Domino's delivers something good enough, cheap enough, and hot enough.

Next year, your pizza will be topped with [cheap 3D printed "meat"](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2023/01/restaurant-review-3d-printed-redefine-meat-unity-diner/) and, while chefs will decry it as an affront to culinary perfection, it'll be cheap and tasty. Besides, you're munching on it while chatting to friends and watching something dopey on Netflix. Call it the rise of "Casual Eating".

    ### DinoNerd says:
    
    In my opinion, there are multiple types of quality.
    
    I notice when the latest app crashes more often than the one it replaces, or when it takes me longer to do the same tasks as before. I don't need to be a software expert to be unhappy that it takes five clicks to do what I used to do with two. I also notice when my new washer takes longer to wash clothes than the old one, and my clothes wear out faster. I'm not an expert on laundry, or appliances. Oddly, though, a lot of people don't seem to be bothered by this sort of thing. I don't know why.
    
    Others notice and are motivated by products which are new, different, and perhaps fashionable. Obviously expensive may also be seen positively. They buy the latest styles of clothes, and perhaps this year's iPhone. Every year. They are often impressed with others who do the same - thus the latest iPhone is useful to display when picking up people in bars. While this doesn't float my boat, I'd say it's a type of quality and quality consciousness.
    
    Finally there's what I'm going to call connoisseur quality. These are subtleties only an expert will notice. Sometimes (most high art) it requires education to like much of anything in the genre - never mind distinguishing grades of quality within it. Sometimes the differences are a bit more meaningful, but won't be obvious without paying more attention than a non-specialist would, or only show up as resilience against rare events. (Thus, IIRC, the covid death rate was lowest in not-for-profit nursing homes; highest in for-profit, and medium in those government run. Who'd have noticed the relevant issues, before the epidemic? Maybe a few patients who had a more miserable experience in for-profit than friends in non-profit? Or maybe only specialists and regulators.)
    
    Finally, I guess there's also suitability to task. I don't need my groceries protected by a steel vault, but I might want to keep expensive jewelry in one. I don't need hot standby resilience in a computer I use at home, but I'd be very unhappy not to have backups - and others wouldn't care about the backups.
    
    Personally, I care a lot about quality in the first sense. I wish providers believed they could make money selling to people that share this preference.
    
    I find lack of suitability to task often contributes to reduced first sense quality. It's much harder to get a snack when your fridge has bank vault security. And while I haven't encountered _that_, consider using one's phone as a calculator. Or being sent an email that says there's new info available on the provider's web site, which requires multi-factor authentication. Much more secure than including the information in the email - but often the information in question doesn't need such security.
    
    And as for the second sense - fashionistas can keep their uncomfortable clothes that cost too much and wear out too fast. They can also keep their status symbol cell phones and cars. I'll be wearing something comfortable and practical, using an elderly phone that was middle-of-the-pack when purchased, and driving a beater that no one would even consider stealing.

    [@Edent](https://mastodon.social/@Edent) this is true of words too, and I believe that’s one reason why LLMs have caught on as tools for writing and editing. To my professional eye, the results are awful, devoid of heart and full of clichés. But most people don’t care. Or even notice.
